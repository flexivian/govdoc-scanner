# GSoC 2025 Project: GovDoc Scanner

**Mentors**: Giannis E. Skitsas, Vasilis Christopoulos

**Assignee**: Eftihis Drakakis

## The Problem

In Greece, essential public company data exists in thousands of unstructured documents across the [Γ.Ε.ΜΗ. (GEMI)](https://publicity.businessportal.gr) portal. This creates significant barriers for:

- **Citizens** seeking transparency in corporate activities
- **Researchers** analyzing business trends and economic patterns
- **Policymakers** requiring data-driven insights for legislation
- **Journalists** investigating corporate structures and ownership

The current format limits transparency and makes systematic analysis nearly impossible.

## The Solution

**GovDoc Scanner** is an open-source tool designed to convert unstructured GEMI portal PDFs into a fully searchable database accessible via a REST API. The GSoC 2025 project successfully delivered a complete implementation that automates the entire document processing pipeline with **AI-powered extraction** and **production-ready infrastructure**.

### Core Components Delivered

- **Automated Document Crawling**: Robust `Playwright` powered crawler with advanced company search filters, intelligent date extraction, and organized document downloads from the GEMI portal
- **AI-Powered Document Processing**: Advanced pipeline using `Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite` for metadata extraction, chronological processing, and specialized Greek legal document analysis
- **Unified CLI Orchestration**: Complete `command-line interface` with interactive prompts, batch processing, progress tracking, and comprehensive error handling that combines all workflow components
- **Production Infrastructure**: Full `OpenSearch integration` with production-ready `REST API server` featuring authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive Swagger documentation for scalable data access
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete `Docusaurus-powered documentation site` with installation guides, code examples, development instructions, and API references

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The project follows a **monorepo structure** with `NPM workspaces` managing five specialized applications under the `apps/` directory, supported by shared infrastructure libraries:

**Application Structure:**

```
apps/
├── crawler/          # Playwright automation for GEMI portal
├── doc-scanner/      # AI document processing pipeline
├── cli/              # Unified command-line interface
├── api/              # Fastify REST API server
└── opensearch/       # Search infrastructure setup
```

### Technical Innovation

**AI-Powered Greek Legal Processing:**

- Custom prompts engineered for Greek corporate document structures (ΦΕΚ, ΓΕΜΗ formats)
- Chronological document sorting with intelligent date extraction from multiple formats
- Representative role identification using Greek legal terminology and ownership patterns
- Change detection comparing document versions for company evolution tracking

**Production-Ready Infrastructure:**

- **Zero-downtime deployment**: Opensearch and REST API docker containerization with health checks and graceful shutdowns
- **Security first**: OpenSearch with TLS encryption, RBAC user management, and dedicated service accounts
- **Scalable data pipeline**: Batch processing with configurable chunk sizes and retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring & observability**: Health check endpoints, backup automation, and cluster monitoring

## Future Development Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements:

## Production Infrastructure

- **Cloud Deployment Strategy**: Scalable cloud architecture with cost optimization and monitoring
- **Administrative Backoffice**: User management, API throttling, access control, and system health dashboards
- **Automated Crawling**: Scheduled crawling operations with administrative control and progress monitoring
