## Project Overview

In Greece, vital public company data is often locked in unstructured PDF files, making it challenging for citizens, researchers, and policymakers to access and analyze this information. The current state of these documents limits transparency and hinders efficient data use. The govdoc-scanner project seeks to bridge this gap by transforming these PDFs into a structured, searchable database, thereby democratizing access to important corporate information.

The govdoc-scanner is an open-source tool designed to convert unstructured GEMI portal PDFs into a fully searchable database accessible via a REST API. It automates the extraction of metadata and document histories, making corporate information more accessible and useful for a wide range of users.

## Current Functionality/Implementation

The repository currently includes two main applications:

- **doc-scanner**: Processes PDF/DOC/DOCX documents for a given GEMI company, extracting metadata and generating a contextual document history in JSON format.
- **crawler**: Scrapes the GEMI portal to search for companies using advanced filters and downloads all available public documents for each company.
- **orchestrator**: A script that automates the workflow of crawling and scanning for multiple GEMI IDs with progress tracking.

All tools are implemented in Node.js and use a combination of CLI interfaces and automated scripts. The project uses Nx for monorepo management.

## Usage Instructions

### Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.x or newer (recommended: v20.x)
  Check your versions with:

```sh
node --version
```

- **.env file**: You must create a `.env` file in the project root with your Gemini API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the project root:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Running the Crawler

To search for companies or download documents:

```sh
npx nx run crawler:start
```

- Use the interactive CLI to search for companies or download documents by GEMI ID(s).
- Results are saved in `ids.txt` and downloaded files in `apps/crawler/src/downloads/{GEMI_ID}/`.

### 3. Running the Doc-Scanner

To process documents and extract metadata:

```sh
npx nx run doc-scanner:start
```

- Place documents in `apps/doc-scanner/src/data/input/{GEMI_ID}/`.
- Output is generated in `apps/doc-scanner/src/data/output/{GEMI_ID}/`.

### 4. Orchestrated Workflow

To automate crawling and scanning for multiple IDs:

```sh
npx nx run orchestrator:start
```

- Follows prompts to select IDs (single or from file).
- Downloads and processes documents, showing progress and summary.
- Output is saved in the `output/` directory at the project root.

## Features Offered

- **Automated Document Downloading**: Bulk or single download of all public documents for any Greek company listed in GEMI.
- **Advanced Company Search**: Filter by name, legal type, status, location, and more.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts structured metadata from company documents.
- **Contextual History Generation**: Builds a timeline of company events from document metadata.
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interfaces for all major workflows.
- **Progress Tracking**: Unified progress bar and summary for batch operations.

## Reasons for Offering & Problem Solved

Access to Greek public company data is hindered by the prevalence of unstructured PDF files. This project addresses the lack of transparency and the inefficiency in data utilization by converting these documents into structured, machine-readable formats.
govdoc-scanner automates:

- Searching for companies with complex filters
- Downloading all available public documents
- Extracting and structuring metadata for analysis
- Building historical timelines for research or reporting

This enables users to efficiently gather and analyze business data at scale, supporting transparency, due diligence, and investigative work.
